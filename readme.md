# node-get-run

`node-get-run` installs specific versions of node, either nightlies or released versions, in a local folder.

## Install

```
$ npm install --global node-get-run
```


## Usage

__For the first time:__

```sh
$ node-get-run --release v12.0.1
{status: installed}
```

And then just use `node-get-run` as if it were `node`:

```sh
$ node-get-run --inspect --debug-brk index.js
```

or

```sh
$ node-get-run index.js
```

## Installation options

 1. `node-get-run --nightly {version}` Install a specific nightly, e.g., `v12.0.0-nightly20181024bb79e768e5`
 2. `node-get-run --release {version}` Install a specific version, e.g., `v12.0.0`
 2. ~~`node-get-run --upgrade` Install the latest nightly~~ (tbd)
 2. ~~`node-get-run --clean` Delete the currently installed version~~ (tbd)


## Credit

This is a derived from node-nightly [node-nightly](https://github.com/hemanth/node-nightly), from which
I got the idea. I changed it to enable a nightly, version, or release to be specified as opposed to just
a nightly. I also removed the ability to just fetch the latest nightly until I think it through. I'm not sure
how `--upgrade` should interact with the version relative to the version currently installed, e.g., if node
`v10.15.1` is installed does `--upgrade` mean upgrade to a more current version of node 10 or the next node
10 nightly past `v10.15.1` or the latest nightly regardless of the node version currently installed.
